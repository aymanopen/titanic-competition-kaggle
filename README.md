I am currently in the top 7 percentile in this kaggle competition I think the most important feature I added was the grouping of travelers having the same ticket number I used many classifiers with cross validations to get the best model...the best performing was the random forest (better than SVM and the others) Some visualizations were done using seaborn and matplotlib to analyze the data
